### This is Kahlua
Kahlua is a bot for Discord! Utilizing the node.js library [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/main/general/welcome).<br>
It has finished it's main production time! The bot is now hosted 24/7. [Invite it!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1037198491652472964&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) <br>

#### Do you need help with this at all?
No, not really. But open a PR if you want! You can contact me on Discord, at Tuva$4626. <br>

#### What about a payment?
No. This is an open-source project, meaning you are contributing on a voluntary basis. <br>
