## Kahlua

### This is Kahlua
Kahlua is a bot. A discord bot. Written in Javascript, utilizing the library to interact with the Discord API called Discord.js. <br>
It is a bot that is designed to be a multipurpose bot, with a focus on moderation and utility. It is currently in development, and is not yet ready for use. <br>
However, that doesn't mean it *can't* be used. It can. It just isn't recommended. <br>
#### Why?
Well, for starters, it's not finished. It's not even close to finished. <br>
It is in a very early stage of development, and is not yet stable. <br>
Whilst using it, you may encounter bugs, and it may not work as intended. Or, you may find the bot goes on and offline during a short time period. This is a testing period. <br>
#### When will it be ready?
When it's ready. <br>
I don't have a set date for when it will be ready. <br>

#### How can I help?
Great question! E-Mail me, the owner of this bot, at stop.ts0894@gmail.com. You can also contact me on Discord, at halt.rs#0894. <br>
You can help me write the guide, or you can help me write the code, or, when the time comes, you could be a pre-selected for a verified helper position within the support server. <br>
#### What about a payment?
No. This is an open-source project, meaning you are contributing on a voluntary basis. <br>
